# 📚 BookShop Management System

A console-based BookShop Management System developed in C++ as a Programming Fundamentals project. This application demonstrates core programming concepts including variables, arrays, pointers, and file handling by providing complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing books in a shop.

## 🧠 Approaches Used

This project showcases **three distinct implementations** of the same functionality:

1. **Simple Variables Approach**  
   - Directly uses standard variables and basic logic for book operations.

2. **Array-Based Approach**  
   - Uses arrays to manage multiple books.
   - Enhances scalability and simplifies data traversal.

3. **Pointer-Based Approach**  
   - Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation.
   - Enhances understanding of pointers and memory management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio / CodeBlocks / Dev-C++  
- **Concepts:**  
  - File handling using `fstream`  
  - Pointer manipulation and dynamic memory  
  - Arrays and basic data structures  
  - Menu-driven user interface

---

## 📁 File Structure

- `Add.txt` – Stores books data for the simple method  
- `AddArray.txt` – Stores books added via arrays  
- `AddPointers.txt` – Stores books added using pointers  
- `Temp.txt` – Temporary file for delete/update operations
